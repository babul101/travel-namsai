<h2>ART & CULTURE</h2>
<hr color="black">
<div class="culture-content">
<p><strong>High country culture is alive and thriving in Namsai every season of the year.</strong></p>
<p>Namsai district is the land of enchanting Pagodas and serenity. The district is inhabited by the peace loving people belonging to the major tribes of <strong>Khamti and Singphos.</strong> 
Each tribe / community have their own culture and traditions which is distinct, rich and unparalleled.</p>
<p><h2><u>TAI-KHAMTI</u></h2></p>
<p>The Tai-Khamti is one of the major tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. The Tai-Khamti inhabits the district of Namsai. 
The word ‘Khamti’ means ‘a land full of gold’ (Kham: gold; ti: place).</p> <p>The Tai-Khamti has a distinct, rich and 
unparalleled culture heritage which has till now remained unexplored in its totality. The community, as a matter of fact, 
is greatly orthodox and all its socio-cultural activities are religious. The Khamti offer prayers to Lord Buddha, 
meaning thereby that they believe in the existence of God, worshipping Lord Buddha whom the Hindus recognize as the 
10th incarnation of God. The form of Buddhism practiced by the Khamti may be termed a progressive form of Buddhism.</p>

<p><h2>Lifestyle and customs:</h2></p>
<p>The Tai-khamti people are very strong believers of Theravada(Hinayana) Buddhism. Every house has a prayer room 
and the families pray every morning and evening with offerings of flower (nam taw yongli) and food (khao tang som). 
They are peace loving people.</p> <p>The Tai-Khamti is the only tribe in the state to be known to have their own script 
which the people call it Tai script (Lik-Tai). They also have varied dwelling systems. Houses of the Tai-Khamti are 
built on raised floors with thatched roofs. The roofs are constructed so low that the walls remain concealed. 
Wooden planks are used for flooring and the walls are made of bamboo splices. But with time everything has changes, 
and in this modern era the style of construction of houses with raised floors and thatched roofs has been replaced by 
cement and bricks buildings. The Khamti have a very rich culture, equipped with magnificent arts and craft. 
Armoury is a part of the life, representing the aura of their skill as warriors. Their weapons include poisoned 
bamboo spikes (panjis), bow and arrows, spear, sword and shields. The Khamti also have firearms, resembling ancient 
flint muskets and horse pistols.</p> <p>The tribe has a preference for conventional attires, enriched by brilliant craft works, 
which command a huge market in the entire Indian market. The beautifully crafted sword, known as Pha-nap, 
is very popular around the state. The sword is carried on the frontal part of the body, so that its hilt can be 
grasped in the right hand if needed. The Khamti crafts in bamboo, wood, bone and ivory are also spectacular. 
They are experts in making traditional weapons. The priests are also known to be amateur craftsmen who use wood, 
bone or ivory to carve out religious statues.</p> <p>The Tai Khamti people are settled agriculturists. They use the plough (Thai) 
drawn by a single animal, either an oxen or a buffalo (or even an elephant in the olden days). They practice both 
jhum and settled agriculture and produce food grains, vegetables and cash crops. Among food grains, coarse varieties of rice, 
maize, millet and cotton are important products of jhum cultivation. Potatoes have been introduced recently. 
Among vegetables potatoes, pumpkins, cucumbers and yams are mainly cultivated. Besides this, tobacco, chilli, ginger 
and indigo is occasionally grown.</p>

<p><h2>Traditional yet contemporary:</h2></p>
<p>By and large, the Tai Khamti culture is deeply rooted in the historical and religious traditions of Tai people, 
and has a profound influence on the way of the royalist society. The society is divided into classes, 
each signifying a distinct status in the social hierarchy. The chiefs occupy the highest positions, followed by the priests, 
who wield considerable influence over all ranks.</p> <p>The costumes of the Khamti men comprise a blue, tight-fitting jacket 
of cotton cloth. Khamti men wear full sleeved cotton shirt (siu pachai) and the deep multi-coloured lungi (pha noi). 
The beauty of women is reflected in the clothes they wear. Very traditional and ethnic yet contemporary Khamti women’s dresses
consist of half-sleeved blouse (sui pashao), a deep coloured skirt (sui) made from cotton or silk, and a coloured silk scarf. 
Jewellery consists of pieces of bright amber earrings and coral and bear necklaces. The all Khamti men traditionally, 
tie their hair into a large knot, which is supported by a white turban. The Khamti chief wears a Chinese coat made of silk. 
The Khamti women traditionally tie their hair in the ‘skyscraper’ style. The hair is drawn up from the back and the sides
in one massive roll, measuring four to five inches in length. This encircled by an embroidered band, the fringed 
and tasselled end of which hang down behind.</p>

<p><h2>Performing Arts:</h2></p>
<p>Dance, drama, theatre or music, every art is unique in itself. In Arunachal Pradesh, dance has come a long way over 
the centuries. Dance in Arunachal Pradesh has evolved into an art form, and the Khamti dance is an example of one such 
evolution. Religions, mythology and classical literature form the basis of most of the performing arts of the Tai Khamti.</p>
<p>Unlike the other dance forms of Arunachal Pradesh, the Khamti dance is a dance-drama that reflects the rich culture 
of the Buddhists in the territory and unfolds the myths and stories of moral values. It marks the celebration of 
Buddhist festivals such as Khamsang, Sangken, Potwah, Poi Lu kyong, Poi Lu Kyong kammathan etc</p> <p>In Arunachal Pradesh, 
Khamti dance is also known as ka pung (‘ka’ implies ‘dance’and ‘pung’ means ‘story’). It is remarkable that the 
preparation for the dance begins a month prior to the festival.</p> <p>The Khamti's are famous for their ‘cockfight dance’. 
It is called Ka-Fi fai is also popular worldwide. The dances are accompanied by musical instruments like drums (gongs), 
cymbals (pi seng), flutes (pee) etc. sometimes songs associated with the dances are sung by both males and females.</p>

<p><h2>Call for celebration:</h2></p>
<p>The ‘Land of Golden Pagoda’ never needs a particular reason to celebrate. Celebration is a fundamental part of 
every Khamti’s life. There are festivals other than Sangken celebrated throughout the calendar year. 
From January to December, every month comes with a particular fair or festival. Mai-Ka-Sung-Phai, Khao-Wa, Poat-Wa, 
Buddha Purnima, Poy Kathing, etc., have their own significance and are celebrated in a religious and boisterous way. 
‘POI PEE MAU’, the New Year festival of the Tai people, is of paramount importance to uniting all Tai’s. 
Its importance as a powerful heritage to preserve age old culture, tradition, literature and games & sports cannot be 
undermined. This Poi is a celebration of oneness and a symbol to disseminate the rich cultural heritage and exotic cuisine
of the Tai’s to the world.</p> <p>There are several festivals of the Khamtis going round the year. Sangken also known as 
"The Water Festival" is the main and the most important and eagerly awaited festival of the Khamtis. It is celebrated 
on 14th April, when the natives welcome the New Year with splendour and magnificence. You can check out the true colours 
of secular India at Sangken festival where people, irrespective of their tribe, caste, culture, race, sex, etc., 
participate in the rituals of the celebrations.</p> <p>The main attraction of the festival is splashing clean water, 
which is the symbol of peace and purity. The images of Buddha are taken out and given the ceremonial bath. 
The procession is accompanied by drums, dances and enjoyment.</p> <p>This holy bath of Lord Buddha is an auspicious event 
in the festival. It comes at the juncture of the months of chaitra and vaisakha, generally during the month of April 
every year. The village youths make preparations for the festival and sets up a temporary temple (kyangphra) 
for the images of Lord Buddha with an indigenous mechanism for spraying water around from a boat (hanglin). 
The images of Lord Buddha of the Vihara (chong) are taken out by priests and kept for bathing in the kyangphra.</p> 
<p>The priests are given a wash and the pouring of the water on the image of Lord Buddha in the kyangphra goes on as 
the boys and girls throw water, colour and mud at each other. In the evening, the villagers come to the chong and 
light innumerable lamps. On the following day, the washing of images of Lord Buddha (Sanphra) goes on.</p> <p>At the end of all this, 
the priests give the last wash to images and puts them back in the vihara. The celebration takes place for 
three consecutive days. During the celebration the locals make home made sweets and distribute them. Exchange of gifts 
is also a common trait of the festival.</p>

<p><h2>It doesn’t have just one:</h2></p>
<p>One of the delights of Khamti food is the tremendous variety offered and the enormous variations of the same dishes, 
giving patrons a great number of choices to satisfy differing taste preferences and varying moods.</p> <p>Needless to mention 
that fragrant rice is the basic ingredient in Tai-style dining. It is prepared as Tai classic steamed rice called khao hai, 
and served either on a plate or wrapped in a tong (leaf) which is then put on the plate. The Khamti’s rich food recipes 
include Tongtep (cakes made of grounded rice), Khawlam (boiled rice and sesame seeds), Paasa (fresh river fish soup with 
special herbs), Paa-som, Nam-Som, etc.</p> <p>The variations in the way the same dishes are made reflect not only the 
creative talents of the people behind the food, but also regional as well as individual taste preferences and the Tai love 
and tolerance for variety.</p> <p>A plate is served in a very traditional form and in this you can enjoy the complete variety 
available in a particular cuisine. To further elaborate on Tai habits, Tai people like to add spice not only into the food 
they eat; they equally enjoy adding spice and excitement to everything they do, even in simple daily routine activities.</p>
<p>Whether you are a first-time visitor or have been living in the Land of Golden Pagoda for longer than you can recall, 
there is always something new, exciting and exotic to experience- especially the multitude and the availability of 
local dishes and cuisines (both traditional and fusion style) that truly express the Tai Khamti culture, 
flavour and attitude towards life.</p>

<p><h2><u>SINGPHOS</u></h2></p>
The SINGPHO society is not as complex as of other tribal societies. The SINGPHO society is divided mainly in 3(three) 
groups such as SISEN, N’KHUM and MIRIP which is further divided into a number of clan each under a chief. 
The clan organization is based on lineage or sub-lineage group. Chieftainship is an important feature of Singpho society. 
The Singpho family system is patriarchal and live in a joint family. But now-a-days with a changing situation 
the family is slowly and gradually braking up from joint family to a single family, as the married sons establish 
separate household. The Singpho women are expert in weaving and they make their own dress themselves. Up till now 
women are using hand-spun and prepared home-made dresses.

<p><h2><u>HANDICRAFT</u></h2></p>
<p>The Khamti's are expert craftsmen and has a preference for conventional attires, enriched by brilliant craft works. 
The beautifully crafted sword, known as Pha-nap, is very popular in the district and the state. The Khamti crafts in bamboo, 
wood, bone and ivory are also spectacular. They are experts in making traditional weapons. The priests are also known 
to be amateur craftsmen who use wood, bone or ivory to carve out religious statues.</p> 
<p>The Khamti women are expert in weaving and they make multi-coloured lungis called the Pha-Noi which is part of the 
costumes of the Khamti men. They also weave deep coloured skirts called Sui made from cotton or silk, and  coloured silk scarfs.</p>
<p>The Singpho women are also expert in weaving and they make their own dresses themselves.</p>
